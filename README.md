## 🧠 MMUKO NEURODIVERGENT OPENREACH INITIATIVE

**Title:**  
**MMUKO: The Spirit for Good and Evil That Connects Us All**

**Hello!**  
This is a special project made by OBINexus.  
It helps people who think and feel in different ways.  
We call this **neurodivergent** — it means your brain is magical and unique.

### 🌱 What is MMUKO?

MMUKO is a system that helps people **reach out** to others.  
It’s like a bridge between **you** and **them**, between **inside** and **outside**, between **feeling** and **doing**.

It’s made for:
- Kids who think in pictures or sounds
- People who feel big emotions
- Anyone who wants to connect safely and kindly

### 🧩 What does it do?

- Helps you **send messages** to the right people
- Keeps your feelings **safe**
- Lets you **choose** who you talk to
- Makes sure **no one is left out**
